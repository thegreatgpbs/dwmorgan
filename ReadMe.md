Open DwmorganApplication.java and change the path of the filename where 'covid_19_data.csv' is located in your computer, and hit save.

Please Start the project by running DwmorganApplication.java
After you see ">>>Read CSV out" on the console, go to browser and access 
http://localhost:8080/top/confirmed?observation_date=2020-01-23&max_results=1

you can change the observation_date value and max_results value

Thanks :)
